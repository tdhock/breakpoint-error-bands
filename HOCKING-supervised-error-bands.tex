\section{Introduction}

There are several methods for computing error bands around estimated
breakpoint locations \citep{Rigaill,Luong}.

\section{Methods}

The goal of this paper is to quantitatively compare these models in
real data sets with labels on pairs of 1breakpoint regions: ``this
breakpoint obviously should have a larger error band than this other
one.''

We can compute the number of incorrect labels for any model. TODO:
compute models for postCP and bcp, and compute the number of incorrect
labels. QUESTION: do these methods have are parameter that needs to be
learned? Train/test split?
