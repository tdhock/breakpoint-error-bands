Breakpoint error bands

There are several different methods for computing error bands on
estimated breakpoint locations

Memory complexity is not discussed in any of the articles.

The bcp is "not appropriate" since it only computes a single
probability vector for a multiple change point model. To compute error
bands (confidence intervals) we need a probability vector for each
breakpoint, as in postCP (buggy, returns matrix of zeros for =cp.est=)
and EBS (too slow, quadratic time complexity).

The idea of this paper is that we can quantitatively evaluate which
method is more appropriate for a given data set, using labels defined
on pairs of 1breakpoint regions. Each label says "this breakpoint
clearly has a smaller error band than this other breakpoint" e.g.

This will not work if one of the methods for computing error bands is
a monotonic transformation of the other. For example if the 90% error
bands of method 1 are always smaller than the 90% error bands of
method 2, than they will have the same number of incorrect labels.
