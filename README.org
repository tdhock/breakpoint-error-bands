Breakpoint error bands

There are several different methods for computing error bands on
estimated breakpoint locations
- [[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252Fs11222-011-9258-8]["Exact posterior distributions..."]] by Rigaill et al.
- [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947313002326]["Fast estimation of posterior probabilities..." by Luong et al]].

The idea of this paper is that we can quantitatively evaluate which of
these two methods is more appropriate for a given data set, using
labels defined on pairs of 1breakpoint regions. Each label says "this
breakpoint clearly has a smaller error band than this other
breakpoint" e.g.

This will not work if one of the methods for computing error bands is
a monotonic transformation of the other. For example if the 90% error
bands of method 1 are always smaller than the 90% error bands of
method 2, than they will have the same number of incorrect labels.
